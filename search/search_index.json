It enables a useful set of extensions and plugins by default, and contains a Makefile that uses Docker to serve the documentation locally, and a Github workflow to publish the documentation on Github Pages by default. To use, invoke: make This will publish the documentation at localhost:8000 by default, and watch for any changes to the documentation source files. Other targets in the Makefile include: serve (default) \u2014 Serves the documentation and watches for changes. build \u2014 Builds the documentation. gh-deploy \u2014 Deploys the documentation to Github Pages. version \u2014 Prints the version information. help \u2014 Prints help information. MkDocs Material Documentation Customization \u00b6 Change the fields in mkdocs.yml to suit your needs. In particular, change the site_name , site_description and site_author , and the URLs for repo_url (where the Github button links to) and edit_uri (where the pages can be edited). Adding Plugins \u00b6 A few plugins have been enabled by default. To add additional plugins, add them to the plugins section of mkdocs.yml ( documentation ) and the required packages to mkdocs_requirements.txt . The plugins are automatically installed into the Docker image. Updating MkDocs Material \u00b6 To change the version of MkDocs Material, change the version number in mkdocs_requirements.txt . The version is automatically updated in the Docker image as well. Serving on a Different Port \u00b6 By default the documentation is served on port 8000 . To change the default temporarily, invoke make like this: make PORT = 8080 To permanently chang the port, change the value of PORT in the Makefile . PORT ?= 8080 Makefile on Top-Level \u00b6 If you want to have the Makefile on the top level instead of in the docs/ directory, move it to the top level directory and change the ROOT variable in the Makefile to: ROOT ?= $( DIR ) /. Note the slash-dot /. at the end. The ROOT directory points to the directory with mkdocs.yml relative to the Makefile . Different branch \u00b6 The template assumes your default branch is named main or master . If it's named something else, change the on push branches in .github/workflows/docs.yml : on : push : branches : - my-docs-branch","title":"MkDocs Material Template"},{"location":"#mkdocs-material-template","text":"This is an MkDocs Material Template repository.
